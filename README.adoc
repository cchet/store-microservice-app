= Store microservice application

This application has been created on the one hand for praticing Quarkus for the Red Hat Certification Cloud-Native-Developer (EX378) and on the other hand for practicing Istio in a Kubernetes environment with a fairly complex application which consists of multiple services and their relating database and a sso server. +

This application runs on the local host with a Docker-Compose infrastructure providing the database instances for the services and a sso service instance. When running locally then the services use https because part of the certification is to secure Quarkus services and rest-clients.

This application runs also on Kubernetes where the services use http, and those services exposed are secured by the ingress controler with TLS termination.

== Application architecture

The store application is an application which consists of 3 microservices along with their corresponding databases and a sso service, for the authentication and authorization.

=== Services

This secion provides a short explanation of the service which are part of the application.

==== store-service

The store-service is a Quarkus based application which proivdes the UI (Quarkus Qute) for the store application. The UI is secured via OpenIDConnect but not the welcome page which is public.

==== order-service

The order-service is a Quarkus based application which handles orders for the store. The service is secured and accepts only JWT tokens with the audience `store-service`, so only users logged into the store can access their placed/fullfiled orders, and can place new orders.

When running locally, the order service exposes a swagger-ui which is also secured via OpenIdConnect. To use it, you need to log in with a user and provide the store client_id and client_credential.

==== warehouse-service

The warehouse-service is a Quarkus based application which handles the available products for the store. The store-service loads available products and the order-service pulls products when a order gets fullfiled. The service is secured and accepts only JWT tokens with the audience `store-service`, so only users logged into the store can access the available products.

When running locally, the warehouse service exposes a swagger-ui which is also secured via OpenIdConnect. To use it, you need to log in with a user and provide the store client_id and client_credential.

==== sso-service

The sso-service is Keycloak which handles the authentication/authorization of users.

Available users:

* Keycloak admin +
  keycloak/keycloak
* Store Customer +
  customer/customer

== Setup

This project requires the following tools to be available on your machine.

* Java 17
* Maven 3.x.x
* quarkus-cli
* openssl
* Docker/Docker-Compose
* An IDE of your choice

For Kubernetes you need

* Kubernetes (e.g microk8s)
* kubectl
* Docker Hub account

== Prepare for local deployments

This section documents the preparation work for running the application locally.

=== Generate secrets

Execute the command `./generate-secrests.sh` in the project root directory to generate the secrets. +
The secrets are generated to `secrets/` directory and the `*.p12` files (keystores and the truststore) and `.env`  files (containing the keystore and truststore secrets) are also copied to the quarkus project and `infrastructure/compose` directories.

IMPORTANT: The `application.properties` files of the applications don't need to be updated, they are already properly configured.

=== Start the infrastructure

Execute the command `docker-compose up` in the directory `infrastructure/compose` to start the sso and database services.

=== Start the application services

Start the application services each one in a own shell with the command `quarkus dev --debug-port 500x`

== Prepare for Kubernetes eployments

Create a Kubernetes namespace and set the current context to it. +
Execut the script `setup-k8s.sh` to create the sso and database services and related resources.

The ingress resources of the services use hostnames for distiguishing the service you want to access, so we need to configure the hostnames as aliases in our `/etc/hosts` file.

`<KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_IP> so.store.mk8s.local store.store.k8s.local`

=== Build the Container Images

This command can be used to build the container images, which are pushed to your Docker Hub account. The build is performed by Docker.

[source,bash]
----
quarkus build \
  -D quarkus.container-image.build=true
  -D quarkus.container-image.group=<YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME>
----

TIP: This command is usefull when you want to try the container images locally.

=== Deploy the services into Kubrenetes

The service can be build and deployed via the following command executed in the projects root directory. 

[source,bash]
----
quarkus build \
  -D quakrus.profile=k8s
  -D quarkus.container-image.group=<YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME>
----

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you are logged into docker via `docker login` in the shell you execute the command from 

== Access the services

The services deployed locally can be accessed via:

. `store` +
link:https://localhost:8443/ui[https://localhost:8443/ui] +
link:https://localhost:8443/q/swagger-ui[https://localhost:8443/q/swagger-ui]
. `warehouse` +
link:https://localhost:8444/q/swagger-ui[https://localhost:8444/q/swagger-ui]
. `order` +
link:https://localhost:8445/q/swagger-ui[https://localhost:8445/q/swagger-ui]
. `sso` +
link:https://localhost:9443[https://localhost:9443]
. `jaeger (Display tracing data)` +
link:http://localhost:16686/search[http://localhost:16686/search]

The services deployed to Kubernetes can be accessed via:

. `store` +
link:https://store.store.mk8s.local/ui[https://store.store.mk8s.local/ui]
. `sso` +
link:https://sso.store.mk8s.local[https://sso.store.mk8s.local]

== How to use Swagger-UI (Local deployments only)

The order-service and warehouse-service host the swagger-Ui which can be used to test the rest endpoints. The servie are secured, so you need to login with a customer user and the store-service client.

image::swagger-ui-authorize.png["Authorize in swagger ui"]

IMPORTANT: The microprofile-jwt scope must be selected, and the store-service client secret `client-secret-store` must be used.

== Technical Notes

=== Keycloak

When the realm is exported via the GUI then no users are exported so export the full realm via the following command which has to be executed in the directory `/opt/keycloak`

.Export realm 
[source,bash]
----
bin/kc.sh export --realm store --dir data/export
----

This will export the realm and users in the project directory `infrastructure/compose/keycloak/export`.

The realm and user export need to be merged, because only the realm is imported during startup and therefore we would miss the users.

The client secrets must be set as `client-secret-<SERVICE_NAME>` e.g. `client-secret-order` which are used for local deployments and are replaced with a dynamically generated secret when deployed to Kubernetes.
