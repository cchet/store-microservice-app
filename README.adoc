= Store microservice application

The store application is an application which consists of 3 microservices along with their corresponding databases and a sso service, for the authentication.

== Keycloak

Keycloak is used as the SSO service the services use for the authentication.

Available users

* Keycloak admin user: +
  keycloak/keycloak
* Store Customer user: +
  customer/customer

=== Notes

When the realm is exported via the GUI then no users are exported so export the full realm via the following command which has to be executed in the directory `/opt/keycloak`

.Export realm 
[source,bash]
----
bin/kc.sh export --realm store --dir data/export
----

This will export the realm and users in teh project directory `infrastructure/compose/keycloak/export`.

The realm and user export need to be merge, because only the realm is imported during startup and therefore we would miss the users.
